StopSec is a wireless protocol designed for cooperative spectrum sharing, enabling primary users to reactively stop interference from secondary users.


"""
This profile is intended for doing any experiment using StopSec. 

This profile can allocate X310 radios (+ compute) and Database Server.

Instructions:
**1) Instantiate this profile with appropriate parameters**

At the "Parameterize" step, add radios that are needed for your planned experiment. Also, speceify the freqeuncy ranges if you are planning to use transmitter(s) in your experiment. 
You can leave the other parameters in this profile at their defaults.
Once you have these parameters selected, click through the rest of the
profile and then click "Finish" to instantiate.  It will take 10
to 15 minutes for the experiment to finish setting up.  Once it
is "green", proceed to the next step.
